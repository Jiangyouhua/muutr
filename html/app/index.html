                    Muutr is a efficiency APP. In recent years, I also want to achieve the first goal. <br>

                    Life, we need to continue to have goals to achieve, have their own, with their own friends, their own and the team. I always wanted to do an APP, to help us better and faster to achieve the goal. <br>

                    For example, I recently had the goal of fitness, Muutr can help me: <br>
                    1„ÄÅ Category management: I used to have a goal of learning, now add a fitness goal. <br>
                    2„ÄÅ Set goals, determine the periodicity goal: To develop fitness goals, determined every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:30 pm before a complete workout at the gym for half an hour. <br>
                    3„ÄÅ Each cycle check goal: Every day, open the APP, Muutr will remind you that this time the task is completed? It also provides a countdown to the deadline? <br>
                    4„ÄÅ Record bit process: Gym teacher said, starting to be slower<br>
                    5„ÄÅ Note the process of revenue: Buy running shoes, spending $588<br>
                    6„ÄÅ Can remind you: Do not forget the task. I am soo busy , so set up a task on Muutr cut-off two hours before the time to remind ourselves; <br>
                    7„ÄÅ Can help you countdown: Muutr told you, an hour's running time is up. The do a yogaÔºõ<br>
                    8„ÄÅ Can move forward with mate: Please Kitty join fitness group, together to fitness;<br>
                    9„ÄÅ Can be composed of people with the common interests of the team: the gym teacher join to fitness group; <br>
                    10„ÄÅTo achieve a division of labor: Gym teacher may not need to run and do yoga, just staring at group, so he did not claim the running and doing yoga tasks; <br>
                    11„ÄÅTo know tasks status of the partners: Kitty is not completed yesterday's gym a half hour fitness task Yes;<br>
                    12„ÄÅCan communicate with partners: Who knows,  Why did not Kitty go to the gym yesterday, ah? <br>
                    13„ÄÅCan be performed with partners whisper: Kitty, I want to tell you a secret;<br>
                    14„ÄÅCan hide your identity: In the group, partners only know your nickname; <br>

                    Then, in 2017 beginning in April, I decided to do Muutr. <br>
                    Whole year to complete, on-line submission time is May 2018. <br>
                    I use a Muutr conducted its own on-line test management, feel better.<br>
